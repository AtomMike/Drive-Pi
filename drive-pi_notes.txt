Front-end for a RaspberryPi-based in-car entertainment and navigation system

Starting the Websockify connection:
-----------------------------------
websockify 8800 localhost:6600
           (listen port)  (MPD server port)

To get the above running on boot:
Create a startup script in: /usr/local/sbin/websockify.local
Make it executable: chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/websockify.local
Create a service in: /etc/systemd/system/websockify.service
Enable the service with: systemctl enable websockify

Starting the web server:
------------------------
cd public_html/www
php -S localhost:8000


(these should be put into a .sh file)
-- Check what worked for this and update above --


External dev/test:
------------------------
Apache service enabled




Front end UI
====================================
BUGS:
Switching to diff album won't update artwork if none set for new one
If in single track view, clicking on title loads the wrong id

TODO:
Main nav selected tab highlight - update between reloads
Clock will often fail to display - try making into directive
View history: Need to return user to same music view if they jumped to another section (done for album view)
Touch on playback widget should shortcut to this too
Transport controls
Widget should retain last played track
Scrollbar for lists
Tabbed overview of path, from root to current track
Highlight playing track & album in lists (done for track)
Background image
Swiper for lists
Start testing physical inputs (gpio)
Pico power supply
Amplifier
Playback widget should allow navigation to the displayed artist/album/track on click
Equalizer display?

Done:
Progress bar - make draggable
